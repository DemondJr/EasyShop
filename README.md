# Project Title
Easy Shop App
## Description of the Project
EasyShop is an online shop where the user can filter through different categories such as colors and price range to find and purchase items they need. In this project we have been given a skeleton code and its our duty to fix the various bugs and well as set up each class that has categories in it in order to run properly.
